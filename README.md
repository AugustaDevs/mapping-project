# The Mapping Project (TMP)

## Introduction

TMP is an open source project that will result in the creation of an application (web/mobile) that provides a robust, interactive experience with local organizations and events. It intends to facilitate community and economic growth through serving several different audiences: the local community, tourists, local businesses and organizations, and new and experienced developers.

The initial target for this project is the Augusta, GA downtown. After that we want to expand it to include the rest of Augusta proper as well as surrounding communities. From there we hope the project will continue to be implemented in communities throughout the world.

### The Local Community

TMP will help locals in the community to explore all that the locale has to offer from events to organizations and businesses. 

### Tourists

TMP will help tourists learn about our community and spend their time in an enjoyable manner by taking advantage of the unique (and often lesser-known) opportunities the locale offers.

### Local Businesses and Organizations

TMP will help local businesses and organizations increase brand name awareness, share information about their events, and offer networking opportunities.

### New and Experienced Developers

#### New Developers

We believe that being able to demonstrate real-world application code allows developers to get a step ahead in a competitive job market.

TMP can facilitate this in a few ways:

1. This is a real-world project that is open source and thus the resultant code is publicly accessible with an auditable history that can be used to demonstrate individual experience and skills.
2. Experienced developers are contributing to the project and eager to assist newer developers in becoming productive and creating real-world code.
3. Working on a collaborative, distributed, open source project drives growth in and demonstrates an individual's real world soft skills.

#### Experienced Developers

TMP offers an opportunity to share some of the goodness most of us have received in our coding journeys. We are who and where we are today because of mentors, co-workers, friends, and strangers who contributed to our learning journey and this is an opportunity for us to show our appreciation for those investments by investing in others.

In addition, TMP will be working across a full-stack on a greenfield project integrating interesting technologies you may not get the opportunity to work on at your regular employment. This is an opportunity to grow your skillset into new areas.

Finally, we hope to see an ecosystem grow around TMP similar to that seen in other community projects (e.g. WordPress, OpenSearch, Supabase) that provides an opportunity for developers to get paid for facilitating specific feature development and implementing the solution for additional customers.
