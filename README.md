# sv

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```sh
# create a new project in the current directory
npx sv create

# create a new project in my-app
npx sv create my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

1. This is a real-world project that is open source and thus the resultant code is publicly accessible with an auditable history that can be used to demonstrate individual experience and skills.
2. Experienced developers are contributing to the project and eager to assist newer developers in becoming productive and creating real-world code.
3. Working on a collaborative, distributed, open source project drives growth in and demonstrates an individual's real world soft skills.

#### Experienced Developers

TMP offers an opportunity to share some of the goodness most of us have received in our coding journeys. We are who and where we are today because of mentors, co-workers, friends, and strangers who contributed to our learning journey and this is an opportunity for us to show our appreciation for those investments by investing in others.

In addition, TMP will be working across a full-stack on a greenfield project integrating interesting technologies you may not get the opportunity to work on at your regular employment. This is an opportunity to grow your skillset into new areas.

Finally, we hope to see an ecosystem grow around TMP similar to that seen in other community projects (e.g. WordPress, OpenSearch, Supabase) that provides an opportunity for developers to get paid for facilitating specific feature development and implementing the solution for additional customers.
