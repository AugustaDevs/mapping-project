# How to Start

## Introduction

The Mapping Project is both a functional service we intend to provide and a learning / growth opportunity. For those who are more experienced in coding the process may be fairly intuitive, but if you are struggling at all please [join the Discord server](https://discord.gg/Wju9NncCwA) and post in the #mapping-project channel - we want to help!

## Steps
- Fork this repo.
- Read [The Next Step](devDocs/THE-NEXT-STEP.md)
- Grab a copy of LeafletJS.
- Start a local development server (see below).
- Dive in.
- When you have interesting things to show, push a PR.

## Running the Development Server

This project requires a local HTTP server to avoid CORS errors when loading JSON files.

Run the development server:
```bash
npm start
```
This will start a server on `http://localhost:8080`. Open that URL in your browser.

To automatically open the browser:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Please
Take notes as you go:
1. What problems did you encounter?
2. What is the best docs / articles you found?
3. How do you do x?
4. What features do we need?
5. What are the limitations of LeafletJS / OpenStreetMap.
6. Write documentation that helps new contributors onboard.
7. All the other things.
