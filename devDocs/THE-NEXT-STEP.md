# The Next Step

## Introduction

On October 7th (2025) at 6 pm several of us gathered at The Second Act on 8th St. in Augusta to discuss our next steps towards The Mapping Project.

## Goals for November 4th

By our next meeting (November 4th) we'd like to have the following:

- A working websites that has a map of downtown Augusta that utilizes [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/) and [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/).
- Several individuals who feel comfortable working with LeafletJS and OpenStreetMap.
- A list of functionality that LeafletJS provides that we believe will be useful in building out the project (as well as notes on limitations).

## After That

We are going super simple to start and using a JSON file for data storage. This will give us some time to delineate data structures and reduce complexity.

Our first _real_ prototype will be a map for First Fridays. It will show the different events occurring on First Friday in a visual manner.
