# Tooling for The Mapping Project

## Dependencies

- Leaflet.js (currently using CDN) - provides the mapping functionality.
- Node.js
  - used to run a local http server to allow browsing the app
  - used to manage dev tooling - e.g. prettier, eslint, vitest

## Required Tooling

- Prettier - code formatting.
- ESLint - code linting.
- Vitest - unit tests.

## Optional Tooling

- IDE
  - Use whatever works for you, just make sure it supports the `.editorconfig` standard. If it doesn't you'll need to enter the settings manually. Visual Studio Code (VSC) and most VSC-based IDEs offer basic built-in `.editorconfig` support.
    - The extension [EditorConfig for VS Code](https://open-vsx.org/extension/EditorConfig/EditorConfig) provides additional functionality if you need it.
