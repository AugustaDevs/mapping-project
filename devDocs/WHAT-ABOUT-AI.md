# What About AI?

You are welcome to use AI in composing code with the following considerations:

1. You need to understand the code the AI writes thoroughly.
    - You should be able to explain to a new developer why the code does what it does and why you chose this method over alternative methods.
2. The code needs to be performant, pragmatic, clean, secure.
3. Do not make large commits, make more numerous small commits.
    - This is easier for us to review and approve.
4. You should have tests for the code you write.
    - Be especially careful if you have AI generate tests as AI often writes tests that pass but don't actually test the desired functionality.

## Rules for AI
There are a number of different files one can provide to an AI to assist it in editing the code in a desired style, structure, using best practices, etc. We'll add rules we believe are worth adding to such a file if you are using AI. You'll need to determine what the appropriate file naming convention is based on the AI tooling you are using. There is not a single standard for providing instructions to AI at this time.
